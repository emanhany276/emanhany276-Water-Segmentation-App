# **Water Segmentation Web Application**

This repository contains a web application for water segmentation using multispectral and optical data. It allows users to upload TIFF images, preprocess them, and generate segmented water masks using a trained deep learning model. The web interface is built with Flask and TailwindCSS, and the backend uses TensorFlow for prediction.

---



## **Features**
- Upload multispectral TIFF images for segmentation.
- Preprocess images with min-max normalization.
- Generate binary water masks using a trained TensorFlow model.
- Display the segmented mask in the web UI.
- Error handling for file upload and prediction failures.

---

## **Requirements**
- Python 3.8+
- Flask
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- rasterio
- Pillow (PIL)

Install the requirements using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## **Usage**
1. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Open in browser:**
   Go to [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)

3. **Upload a TIFF file:**
   - Click "Choose File" and select a `.tif` or `.tiff` image.
   - Click "Upload" to generate the water mask.
   - The segmented mask will be displayed below the upload button.

```

## **Model**
- The model is a TensorFlow-based deep learning model trained to perform water segmentation on multispectral data.
- It outputs a probability mask where each pixel indicates the probability of being water.
- The binary mask is created using a threshold of 0.5.

---

## **Normalization**
- The model expects normalized input:
  - Min-Max normalization is applied to each band of the image.
  - Formula used:  
    \[
    \text{normalized\_image} = \frac{\text{image} - \min}{\max - \min + 1e-7}
    \]
- Ensures values are scaled between 0 and 1.

---

## **Error Handling**
- **File Upload:**
   - Returns a 400 error if no file is uploaded or if the file type is unsupported.
- **Prediction:**
   - Returns a 500 error if an exception occurs during prediction.
